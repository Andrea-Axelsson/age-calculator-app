## My process

### Built with

    -TypeScript: This project was an excellent opportunity to dive into TypeScript, enhancing code quality and reliability.

    -React with React-Spring: The app is built with React, utilizing the react-spring library for adding lively animations.

    -Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across different screen sizes.

    -CSS: Custom CSS styles for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

### What I learned

This project was a significant milestone in my development journey, marking my first foray into TypeScript and advanced animations with react-spring. Here are some key learnings:

    -TypeScript Integration: Initially, TypeScript posed a challenge, but it soon proved its worth in ensuring type safety and reducing runtime errors.

    -React-Spring: Using react-spring for the first time was exciting. It allowed me to create more dynamic, smooth, and engaging animations that enhanced the overall user experience.

    -Component Design: Balancing functionality and aesthetics within React components was crucial. I focused on creating a seamless flow between user input and animation feedback.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further explore TypeScript's capabilities and delve deeper into animation libraries like react-spring. I'm also interested in improving my skills in state management and exploring more complex animations and interactions.
